## bookstores and framework that I use in the project

I have used Meteor v1.4 with Blaze and Foundation.

To add Foundation in Meteor project can be done with two steps (if you use scss):

* insert this command in your terminal  `meteor add zurb:foundation-sites`

after throw the last command, We add in our main.scss foundation import:

* `@import '{zurb:foundation-sites}/scss/foundation';`

To add scss in your project you only change the extension `.css ` for `.scss`

## packages of the project

The first package that I have use  is `iron:router` to do a simple routing with parameters (in imports > api > tasks.js)
* insert the package with this command `meteor add iron:router`
