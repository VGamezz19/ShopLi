### bookstores and framework that I use in the project

I have used Meteor v1.4 with Blaze and Foundation.

For add Foundation in Meteor project can be done with two steps (if you use scss):

* insert this command in your terminal  `meteor add zurb:foundation-sites`

after throw the last command, We add in our main.scss foundation import:

* `@import '{zurb:foundation-sites}/scss/foundation';`

For add scss in your project you only change the extension `.css ` for `.scss`

## packages of the project

I used the package `iron:router` to do a simple routing with parameters
* insert package with this command `meteor add iron:router`
